## What is a transitive closure

The transitive closure of a relation on a set is a new relation that captures the "transitive" property of the original relation. In other words, it includes all the pairs that can be reached through the transitive property of the original relation.

```
X = {1,2,3,4}
R  = {(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,2), }
```
